          I am a software developer who is deeply passionate about learning,
          expanding my network, and constantly improving. Although I am
          currently residing in Ecuador, I was born in Venezuela and Iâ€™m half
          Portuguese. My goal is to consistently strive for personal growth and
          ensure that I am a better version of myself by the end of each day. I
          maintain an open mindset, always eager to acquire new knowledge and
          skills.
